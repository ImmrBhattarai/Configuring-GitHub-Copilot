# Installing and Configuring GitHub Copilot with Visual Studio Code (VScode) | DIO Project | Microsoft Cloud Native Bootcamp
Practical activity that involves preparing the development environment with GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code to assist in programming.

## 1. Roulette Physics Simulation (Cloud/roulette-physics-simulation/):
This project was carried forward to get familiar with pair programming powered by GitHub Copilot (Antropic's Claude Sonnet 3.7), and adopt AI tools for rapid development assistance.

This project simulates the physics of a roulette wheel, including ball and wheel movement.
It uses JavaScript for logic (main.js, ball.js, physics.js, wheel.js), CSS for styling, and includes sound assets for realism.
There is a test file (hello.test.js), suggesting you are incorporating testing practices.

## 2. Flappy Bird Clone (Gemini/flappy-bird/):

This is a browser-based clone of the Flappy Bird game, developed with Gemini Flash 2.5 Pro Model using GitHub Copilot.
It includes separate JavaScript files for the bird, game logic, and pipes, as well as styling and documentation.

## 3. Node.js CEP API (o3/API/node-cep-api/):

This is a Node.js API project, for verifying validity of (or querying) Brazilian postal codes (CEP).
It has a clear structure with routes, services, and tests, following good backend development practices.

For postal code validation, I tried with a Postal Code containing non numeric charcter (invalid Postal Code), and the response was as shown below.
"CEP inválido. Por favor, forneça apenas números até que o governo resolva" which translates to "Invalid CEP (Postal/ZIP Code). Please provide only numbers until the government resolves it." in English.

### What I did with the project:
- ✅ Organized projects by topic or technology.
- ✅ Separated concerns (logic, assets, styles, tests).
- ✅ Used version control and documentation.
- ✅ Practiced both frontend (simulations, games) and backend (API) development.
